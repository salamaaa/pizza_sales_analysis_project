📊 Pizza Sales Data Analysis and Dashboard

Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of sales data from a fictional pizza restaurant chain. The objective was to transform raw transactional data into actionable business intelligence by cleaning and structuring the dataset, performing complex analytical queries using SQL, and visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends in an interactive Power BI dashboard.

This repository contains the following:

Python scripts for initial Data Loading, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and cleaning.

SQL scripts containing all queries used for data aggregation and metric calculation.

The final Power BI workbook (pizza_sales_analysis_dashboard.pbix).

📁 Dataset

The primary dataset consists of 48,620 rows of transactional data spanning a one-year period.

🛠️ Tools and Technologies

Tool

Purpose

Python (Pandas, Numpy)

Data loading, initial cleaning, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

PostgreSQL

Database management and execution of complex aggregate, join, and window function queries.

SQL

Calculation of KPIs, time-series metrics, and product performance rankings.

Power BI

Designing and implementing a dynamic, interactive business intelligence dashboard.

🚀 Key Steps and Methodology

Data Loading and Cleaning (Python):

The dataset was loaded into a Python environment using the pandas library.

Initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to check for missing values, unique values, and data types.

Data cleaning included converting date and time fields to the correct format and ensuring data consistency across product attributes.

Database Migration (PostgreSQL):

The cleaned data was imported into a PostgreSQL database instance.

This step ensured a reliable environment for executing large-scale, complex SQL calculations.

Advanced SQL Querying:

Calculated core Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Total Revenue, Total Orders, Average Order Value (AOV), and Total Pizzas Sold.

Performed Time-Series Analysis to determine peak sales days (Day of Week) and months.

Ranked products using ORDER BY and aggregate functions to identify Top 5 and Bottom 5 pizzas by revenue and volume.

Analyzed revenue distribution by pizza_category and pizza_size.

Dashboard Development (Power BI):

Connected Power BI directly to the PostgreSQL database.

Designed a visually appealing and functional dashboard with slicers and filters for deep-dive analysis.

Utilized charts (line charts, donut charts, bar charts) to clearly display trends and performance metrics.

📈 Dashboard and Visualizations

The final Power BI dashboard allows users to dynamically track the following insights:

KPI Tracking: Real-time values for Revenue, AOV, Total Orders, and Total Pizzas Sold.

Temporal Trends: Line charts showing order volume by hour, day of the week, and month to inform staffing and operational capacity planning.

Product Performance: Ranked lists of the best and worst-performing pizzas, and breakdowns of revenue contribution by size and category.

✨ Key Results and Business Impact

Peak Demand Identified: Confirmed that Fridays and Saturdays account for the highest order volume, requiring strategic staffing.

Product Focus: Identified the Top 5 revenue-generating pizzas, informing marketing efforts and inventory prioritization.

Average Order Size: Established the AOV, which serves as a benchmark for future promotional strategies aimed at increasing basket size.

🏃 How to Run

To explore the analysis and dashboard, follow these steps:

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python (with Pandas installed), PostgreSQL, and Power BI Desktop.

Database Setup: Create a new schema in your PostgreSQL environment and import the cleaned dataset.

SQL Scripts: Review the SQL queries in the pizza_sales_queries.sql file to see the logic used for data aggregation.

Open Dashboard: Open the pizza_sales_analysis_dashboard.pbix file using Power BI Desktop. You may need to update the data source settings to connect to your local PostgreSQL instance.

This project demonstrates proficiency in the full data analysis lifecycle: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), SQL-based data manipulation, and impactful data visualization.
